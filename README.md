# Gallery

This is a gallery based web app for users to upload,update and manage their photos.

## Goal
To understand OOP concepts of PHP and how to use it in building web apps and other practical scenarios. 


## Tech Used
1. Object oriented concepts of PHP and mysql to build the backend.
2. Bootstrap framework was used for the front end UI.
3. Made use of [masonry.js](http://masonry.desandro.com/) for displaying images in a masonry grid form on home page.
4. Made use of  [Dropzone.js](www.dropzonejs.com) for providing drag’n’drop file uploads with image previews.

## Roadmap
1. AJAX based file editing.
2. Pagination on home page.
3. Make the app responsive on smaller devices and use cleaner CSS.
